# Qureshi Messaging Queue ()

 is a lightweight, high-performance messaging queue system designed for efficient communication between distributed services. Built with Go,  facilitates asynchronous message processing, allowing for scalable and decoupled architectures.

## Key Features

* Asynchronous Messaging: Enables services to communicate without waiting for a response, improving throughput and latency.
* Distributed Processing: Supports distributed system architectures, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.
* Protocol Buffers: Utilizes Protocol Buffers for efficient data serialization and deserialization, enhancing performance and compatibility.
* Extensible Architecture: Modular design allows for easy integration with various systems and customization as per requirements.

## Components

* Application: Manages the lifecycle of the messaging queue system, ensuring smooth initialization and deinitialization.
* Connection: Handles network connections, providing a reliable communication channel between producers and consumers.
* Consumer: Consumes messages from the queue, processing them as per the application logic.
* Producer: Produces messages to be sent to the queue, enabling asynchronous communication between services.
* Locker: Ensures thread safety and synchronization across distributed components.
* Logger: Facilitates comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.
* Stream: Supports streaming capabilities for continuous data processing.

## Getting Started

To set up , ensure you have Go installed and follow these steps:
